If you ever see the error message SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal, you probably forgot the final single quote character at the end of the string

“A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.”

― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance

"Functions"

str() - handy when you have an integer or float that you want to concatenate to a string

int() - helpful if you have a number as a string value that you want to use in some mathematics

float() - return a floating point number constructed from a number or string

round() - returns the nearest integer to its input.

len() - takes a string and evaluates to an int of the number of characters in the string

print() - simple text output (to the screen)

input() - input (from the keyboard)
#always returns a string, even if the user enters a number

+, -, *, /, //, %, and ** for math operations | + and * for string operations

"Expressions" consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +)

#Flow Control

Boolean Values - True and False

Comparison Operators(aka Relational Operators) - compare two values and eval down to a single Boolean value

== (equal to) != (not equal to) < (less than) > (greater than) <= (less than or equal to >= (greater than or equal to)

== and != will work with values of any data type

**Integer or floating-point value will always be unequal to string value (Example: 42 == '42' is False)

Boolean Operators - 'and' 'or' 'not'

'and'- evaluates an expression to be True if both Boolean value are True; otherwise. it evaluates to False (binary operator)

'or' - evaluates an expression to be True if either of the two Boolean values is True. If both are False it evaluates to False. (binary operator)

'not' - evaluates to the opposite Boolean value. (unary operator)

Order of operations = 'not' --> 'and' --> 'or'

Conditions always evaluate down to a Boolean value, True or False. 

A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is True or False, and almost every flow control statement uses a condition.

if Statements - if this condition is true, executre the code in the clause. Clause skipped if condition is False. 

else Statements - executed only when the if statement's condition is False

elif Statements - always follows an if or another leif statement - provides another condition that is checked only if all of the previous conditions were False. 

At most only one of the clauses will be executed, and for elif statements, the order matters!
